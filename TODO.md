 - Fix The Null Names in link.html
 - Build score.html
   - Display User Score
   - Give Box/button to Enter Name
   - Display sendable link
 - Build Rename.php
   - Should take a string and a uid, and update the uid only if it's name is currently null
 - Build GetStats.php
   - Should take a uid and return the persons score, the total people affected because of them, and their name
 - Build score-ajax.js
   - Display the information returned by GetStats.php
   - Use functionality of Rename.php to let a user rename themselves if their name is currently null
 - Optimize Score Calculation
   - Rather than calculating the score every time a user visits the score page, add a score attribute to users and recurse up parents (should only occur once) and update scores then
   - Change CalculateSenderScore in SpreadBlaze.php to generate a select query for the score attribute
